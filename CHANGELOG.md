### Fixed

- [#158](https://github.com/vilhelmprytz/pterodactyl-installer/issues/158) panel: Fixed a bug that would let users run the panel script on other CPU architectures than `x86_64`, script now prints a warning if the user is using anything but `x86_64` (thanks [@Linux123123](https://github.com/Linux123123) for contributing!).

### Changed

- [#168](https://github.com/vilhelmprytz/pterodactyl-installer/pull/168) panel: Use PHP version 8.0 over 7.4 for all supported installations (thanks [@Linux123123](https://github.com/Linux123123) for contributing!).

## v0.3.0 (released on 2021-02-24)

### Fixed

- [#151](https://github.com/vilhelmprytz/pterodactyl-installer/issues/151) panel: `APP_ENVIRONMENT_ONLY` was set to `true` when it should be `false`. This caused the panel to prohibit modifying the settings from the web interface, which is not intended behavior.
- [#165](https://github.com/vilhelmprytz/pterodactyl-installer/issues/165) panel: Fix so that the `pteroq` service uses the correct user on CentOS (thanks [@PipeItToDevNull](https://github.com/PipeItToDevNull) for reporting!).

- [#153](https://github.com/vilhelmprytz/pterodactyl-installer/pull/153) panel/wings: Changed so that the script will no longer tell you to open firewall ports if you have enabled automatic firewall configuration.

### Added

- [#148](https://github.com/vilhelmprytz/pterodactyl-installer/issues/148) wings: Added so that the Wings installation script will now verify FQDN using `lib/verify-fqdn` if the user chooses to configure Let's Encrypt automatically.

## v0.2.0 (released on 2021-01-18)

### Fixed

- [#113](https://github.com/vilhelmprytz/pterodactyl-installer/issues/113) panel: Fixed a bug that would cause the script to exit due to failing to create a "bus connection". Related to [#115](https://github.com/vilhelmprytz/pterodactyl-installer/issues/115) as well.
- [#135](https://github.com/vilhelmprytz/pterodactyl-installer/issues/135) panel/wings: Fixed so that the automatic ufw firewall configuration no longer requires confirming for the enable operation (user interaction after initial configuration is not intended behavior).

### Changed

- [#88](https://github.com/vilhelmprytz/pterodactyl-installer/issues/88) panel: Changed so that certbot now uses `certbot --nginx` over `certbot certonly` which makes it easier to perform certificate renewals later on (thanks [@Linux123123](https://github.com/Linux123123)).
- [#100](https://github.com/vilhelmprytz/pterodactyl-installer/pull/100) panel: Refactor several different functions in panel script, removal of redundant variables and functions and general cleanup/restructure (thanks [@Linux123123](https://github.com/Linux123123)).

- [#137](https://github.com/vilhelmprytz/pterodactyl-installer/issues/137) panel: Removed ability to run `p:environment:mail` script since it's redundant.

- [#78](https://github.com/vilhelmprytz/pterodactyl-installer/issues/78) panel: Add option to auto-generate MySQL passwords and remember them throughout the installation.

## v0.1.1 (released on 2021-01-01)

### Fixed

- [#133](https://github.com/vilhelmprytz/pterodactyl-installer/issues/133) panel: Fixed the `verify-fqdn.sh` so that it now installs the packages quietly. Panel script will now only execute the FQDN verification if `ASSUME_SSL` or `CONFIGURE_LETSENCRYPT` is true.
